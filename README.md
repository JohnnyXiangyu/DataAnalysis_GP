# General

Python library of utilities useful in designing laboratory data collection system  
Useful when data end is transmitting data through serial communication

## TODO

### Get the test module back online

### Implement a virtual object that can simulate port behavior

### Support selective import upon detection of Windows/Linux operating system

Define new type of exception in utils.py  
Write code at beginning of each OS-specific module that throw exception when OS mismatch is found.  
Note to myself: import symbols instead of whole module can solve module name issue  
Use C/C++ to write a python module that supports terminal input
